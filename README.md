### NOTE:

The video eventListener for play fires up too early on low-end machines, before the video is fully loaded, which causes errors to pop up from the Face API and terminates the script (tested on Debian [Firefox] and Windows [Chrome, Firefox]). Replaced by playing event, which fires up when the media has enough data to start playing.



Cheers !
